##Where can this application be accessed from? (URL)
This will be accessible from Heroku.  I’m not sure what exactly the URL is because we have yet to get a version that is even close to deployable or even discuss the name of the website.  I’m just going to make an executive decision and say it will be at ‘nigma.heroku.com’.
