This application is aimed towards Champlain College students 
or anyone who uses twiiter in general. Our application is designed to 
take two hashtags and list out multiple results based on those two 
hashtags based on hashtags entered, date they were posted, and a 
mile radius around the users location using the twitter API. It also 
will be able to compare the sentiment score of the returned posts with 
that of the same hashtags on different days with different weather 
conditions using a weather API on github. The application should be 
available by Teusday November 3rd at http://hadzz.com:5000/.
